## A Discord bot made in 5 days and a few hours!

A very cool proof of concept using voice channels, connections, streaming and receiving; this bot is able to communicate through multiple servers/guilds!
Basically, the bot has a **global chat** implementation, but not a basic chat; it's a **voice chat**!
With the ability to join/leave rooms, you can listen to people from other servers that are in the same room as yours, talk to them real-time, and have fun all together!

Basic example of room connections:

## Basic commands
Default prefix is **!** (not configurable yet)
> !help [Display helpful info and all commands]

> !say [Just repeat exactly what you said]

## Voice chat commands
> !vc join [Joins the current channel you are in]

> !vc leave [Forces the bot to leave the channel]

> !vc rooms [Lists all rooms available]

> !vc join room [Joins a non-full room]

> !vc join room (room name) [Join a room by given name]

> !vc leave room [Leave the room currently connected to]

Obviously, this bot is still in its beta phase, but the cool stuff is already working like a charm, so feel free to try it out at [My test server](http://link.com)
